Using the data assigned to your team (you will get zero if your team uses a wrong data set), 
and using the 1500 randomly sampled locations only, do the following. 
(Note: before you sample 1500 locations, remember to get rid of rows with any NAs.)

1.	Draw a spatial map (using quilt.plot command in fields) of median_house_value. 
Discuss what you observe in its spatial pattern.

2.	Perform a linear regression (nothing spatial! Use lm command in R) 
on median_house_value using the following covariates: longitude, latitude, housing_median_age, total_bedrooms, median_income
Discuss results of linear regression.

3.	Draw a spatial map of the residuals from part 2. Compare the two spatial maps 
(map of residuals with the map of original values from part 1) 
regarding their spatial variation and patterns (similar to an example given in class last week).

4.	Compare histogram of original values of median_house_value to the histogram of residuals from part 2. Discuss how the two histograms compare.
