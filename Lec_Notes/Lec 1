Download “data-lecture1.RData” from TEAMS. The data
set consists of x, y, and two more variables A and B at
each spatial location. Using R and software fields, do the
following:

1. Draw a scatter plot of A (x-axis)and B (y-axis).

2. Perform linear regression on B using A. Summarize your
results of the regression and discuss the relationship
between the two variables A and B.

3. Plot a ”map” of B (use ”quilt.plot” command in R
package fields)

4. Repeat 1 for the residuals from the regression in 2.
Discuss similarities or differences betwen the two
spatial maps of B and the residuals.
