#Download “data-lecture1.RData” from TEAMS. The data
#set consists of x, y, and two more variables A and B at
#each spatial location. Using R and software fields, do the
#following:
#  1. Draw a scatter plot of A (x-axis)and B (y-axis).
#2. Perform linear regression on B using A. Summarize your
#results of the regression and discuss the relationship
#between the two variables A and B.
#3. Plot a ”map” of B (use ”quilt.plot” command in R
#                      package fields)
#4. Repeat 1 for the residuals from the regression in 2.
#Discuss similarities or differences betwen the two
#spatial maps of B and the residuals.

A = sample(x = c(1:10), size = 100, replace = TRUE)
B = sample(x = c(1:20), size = 100, replace = TRUE)

Data = data.frame(A,B)
